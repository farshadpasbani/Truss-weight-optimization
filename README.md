# Truss Analysis and Optimization Documentation
This documentation provides an overview of the functions and modules for analyzing and optimizing a truss structure using finite element analysis and the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm.

There are three scripts working side by side

## Structural Optimization
Structural optimization involves finding the optimal configuration of a truss to meet certain criteria such as minimum weight, cost, or deflection. Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is used to iteratively improve the design by adjusting parameters (cross-sectional areas of the members in here) while respecting constraints on stresses and displacements.
